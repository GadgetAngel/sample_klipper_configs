 Some of the klipper setups i have actually used and tested

## MK2 Bear
This is a prusa mk2 frame with a [AfterBEARner](https://www.printables.com/model/54545-afterbearner-the-prusa-bear-afterburner/files) setup for an improved X and to try a vornon stealthburner.

This version is for a Bigtreetech SKR2 MCU and is currently in use as my main ABS printer.
